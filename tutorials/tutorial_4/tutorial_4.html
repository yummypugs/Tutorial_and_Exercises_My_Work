<h1>Analysis, Tools and Craftsmanship</h1>
<p>Data Science is never about using one tool to solve all problems, but picking the right tool for the appropriate ones. The practice of Data Science has become half science and half engineering. This means that you are continuously figuring out the problem you are trying to solve, understanding principles of different steps in the workflow, and apply different tools accordingly.</p>
<p>The academia and industry dealing with data and science is often messy and chaotic. One prime example is the usage of Excel. See <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988">why using Microsoft’s tool caused Covid-19 results to be lost</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24689247">its Hacker News discussion</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates">scientists rename human genes to stop Microsoft Excel from misreading them as dates</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwRdO9_GGhY">science as amateur software development</a>. Personally, I believe that Excel should never be used for any computation. Today, programming languages offer a much better abstraction layer than Excel. And software engineering practices make data analysis much less error-prone.</p>
<p>Of course, mistakes can still happen even when you are using programming languages and state-of-the-art libraries, unreadable, unmaintainable and unreproducible data analysis using notebooks is equally bad as using Excel. But, there are certain conventions, tools and practices that help you navigate in this complex work flow and produce something meaningful. Thus, I call the process of producing good data analysis a craftsmanship. This tutorial will walk you through the process of making an efficient, maintainable and reproducible data analysis project.</p>

<h1>Git</h1>
<p>Git is the most basic tool for tracking software changes and collaboration. By now, you should have some ideas of using Git. Let us start by creating a Git repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>Then we clone the repository and create a new git branch and call it <code>fancy-feature</code>:</p>
<pre><code>git branch fancy-feature</code></pre>
<p>You can give the new branch any name, but ideally it should reflect what you are tring to do in this branch. Later when the feature is finished, you can safely merge this branch into main branch and delete it.</p>
<p>We use <code>environment.yml</code> to set up a new conda environment. In the beginning, you may not specify the version numbers since you are actively developping the softwares. But in the later stage you should freeze your dependency versions or do rigorous dependency testing.</p>
<pre><code>mamba env create -f environment.yml</code></pre>
<p>Feel free to invite my Github and Gitlab handle <code>iewaij</code> into your repository. I will review your code and make suggestions from time to time.</p>

<section id="style-and-convention" class="level1">
<h1>Style and Convention</h1>
<p>Convention makes our brain hurt less. Code is written for humans to read, only incidentally for machines to execute (quote from Harold Abelson). PEP 20, known as the Zen of Python, is about style and how to write Pythonic code.</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="1">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="im">import</span> this</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>PEP 8 specifies the standard Python coding conventions. For example, we use 4 consec­utive spaces to indicate indent­ation. Variables are named as <code>x</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>my_var­iable</code> while classes are named as <code>Model</code>, <code>MyClass</code>. There are certain libraries to help you conform to the style guide. I will illustrate using <a href="https://github.com/psf/black"><code>black</code></a>. If you are using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebooks, you can use <a href="https://github.com/dnanhkhoa/nb_black">nb_black</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ryantam626/jupyterlab_code_formatter">jupyterlab-code-formatter</a>.</p>
<p>As a beginner, you may find these rules difficult to comprehend. This is normal and you will understand what makes code “pythonic” from experiences. Programming is a craft. Try to read other people’s code and ask people’s feedback on your code, this will help you become a true “pythonista”.</p>

<h1>Prepare Data</h1>
<p>Now, with things set up and running, we can finally get our hands on data. Often, the data you have is not clean. We need to clean the data into a tidy format. What do we mean by that?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper">Tidy data</a> is a concept proposed by Hadley Wickham. Wickham formulizes the process of data cleaning and what we should expect in the end. The three interrelated rules that make a dataset tidy are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Each variable must have its own column.</li>
<li>Each observation must have its own row.</li>
<li>Each value must have its own cell.</li>
</ol>

<p>Take the mushroom dataset in tutorial 2 for example. We can see that the <code>stem-height</code> and <code>stem-width</code> fields are text fields indicating the range. To tidy this data for future processing, we need to convert this range either into the mean values or into separate columns such as <code>stem-height-low</code> and <code>stem-height-high</code>.</p>

<p>It should be noted that preparing data does not have to be done in Python. If you are dealing with large dataset in a database, it makes more sense to query them using SQL. Pandas is also not perfect, it was started as a side project when Wes McKinney was working as a quant researcher at AQR on econometirc panel data. Hence the name of the libray, pandas, is short for panel data analysis. There were many design choices of pandas that were not obvious to make when it was invented, which later lead to Wes McKinney’s <a href="https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/">10 things he hates about pandas</a>. When pandas starts to struggle with large in-memory dataset and slow groupby functions, <a href="https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/">polars</a> and <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/">duckdb</a> can be very good alternatives.</p>

<p>In your terminal, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>pytest test_birthday.py</code></pre>
<p>Or simply use <code>pytest</code> to automatically detect the test functions in the folder:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
<p>In your repository, you may notice there is a <code>README.md</code> file. This is a markdown text file. In notebooks, you can write markdown alongside with code to better communicate with stakeholders. This practice is known as literature programming and is commonly adopted by data scientists. Surely, you can write everything in a Word document. But markdown gives you the flexibility to think, code and write at the same time. Markdown also let you focus on writing rather than formatting, include citations and math equations painlessly, and execute code in the documentation.</p>
<p>A document typically is divided into multiple sections. To make a new section, you give it a header. The headers start with a hashtag (<code>#</code>). Using one hashtag means a level-one header. Two hashtags means a level-two header.</p>

<p>We emphasize part of a text by putting it in italic or boldface. In Markdown, we wrap asterisks (<code>*</code>) around the word to achieve this. One asterisk puts the work in italic, and two asterisks put it in boldface.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb23-1"><a href="#cb23-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Some of the **greatest** discoveries in *science* were made by ***accident***.</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<p>To create a numbered list, you put a number, followed by a period, at the start of a line and write the list item after it.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb24-1"><a href="#cb24-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">1. </span>This is a numbered list.</span>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="latex"><span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span></h2>
<p>Before Markdown was invented, document typesetting is often done by <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span>. The syntax is very bloated, but it allows you to produce any kind of documents. Often, you just use a <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> template made by others. For example, my <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/htmbyyjzfqpz">CV</a> is made by <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> with some modifications on someone else’s code.</p>
<p>You can use <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> in Markdown. Since <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> is almost the only way to display math blocks properly. Inline math equation is wrapped by the dollar sign ($).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb26-1"><a href="#cb26-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Here we define $m = ab$.</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<p>A math block is surrounded by two dollar signs.</p>

<p>Most of the time, when you work with math equations, you just want to copy them from the slides or the books. You may find <a href="https://mathpix.com/">mathpix</a>, an OCR tool for math equations, very helpful. You can also create your formulas using <code>sympy</code> and export them into <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span>.</p>

<h1>Package</h1>
<p>Now, we have a documented <code>.py</code> file, a notebook that documents our analysis and a bunch of unit tests. We can reorganize the folder a bit and add <code>setup.py</code> and <code>__init__.py</code>.</p>
<pre><code>craftsmanship/
    birthday/
        __init__.py
        clean.py
        plot.py
        ...
    test/
        test_clean.py
        test_plot.py
    notebook/
        exploration.ipynb
        ...
    setup.py
    ...</code></pre>
<p>The content of <code>setup.py</code> should be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb32"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb32-1"><a href="#cb32-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="im">from</span> setuptools <span class="im">import</span> setup, find_packages</span>
<span id="cb32-2"><a href="#cb32-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb32-3"><a href="#cb32-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>setup(</span>
<span id="cb32-4"><a href="#cb32-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    name<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"birthday"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb32-5"><a href="#cb32-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    version<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"0.1.0"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb32-6"><a href="#cb32-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    packages<span class="op">=</span>find_packages(),</span>
<span id="cb32-7"><a href="#cb32-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<p>In the <code>__init__.py</code>, we can add:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb33"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb33-1"><a href="#cb33-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="im">from</span> birthday.clean <span class="im">import</span> clean_dataset</span>
<span id="cb33-2"><a href="#cb33-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="im">from</span> birthday.plot <span class="im">import</span> plot_day_of_year</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<p>We can now install the package in the virtual environment. You can use the pip command to achieve that:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -e .</code></pre>
<p>After making sure the tests are passed, we can push our changes and make pull requests. Code reviews should be carried here. Don’t worry too much about code reviews or pull requests if you are aiming to iterate your codebase quickly, it all depends on your team’s work style and schedule.</p>
