        "\n",
        "Data Science is never about using one tool to solve all problems, but picking the right tool for the appropriate ones. The practice of Data Science has become half science and half engineering. This means that you are continuously figuring out the problem you are trying to solve, understanding principles of different steps in the workflow, and apply different tools accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The academia and industry dealing with data and science is often messy and chaotic. One prime example is the usage of Excel. See [why using Microsoft's tool caused Covid-19 results to be lost](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988), [its Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24689247), [scientists rename human genes to stop Microsoft Excel from misreading them as dates](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates) and [science as amateur software development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwRdO9_GGhY). Personally, I believe that Excel should never be used for any computation. Today, programming languages offer a much better abstraction layer than Excel. And software engineering practices make data analysis much less error-prone. \n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, mistakes can still happen even when you are using programming languages and state-of-the-art libraries, unreadable, unmaintainable and unreproducible data analysis using notebooks is equally bad as using Excel. But, there are certain conventions, tools and practices that help you navigate in this complex work flow and produce something meaningful. Thus, I call the process of producing good data analysis a craftsmanship. This tutorial will walk you through the process of making an efficient, maintainable and reproducible data analysis project.\n",

        "It should be noted that preparing data does not have to be done in Python. If you are dealing with large dataset in a database, it makes more sense to query them using SQL. Pandas is also not perfect, it was started as a side project when Wes McKinney was working as a quant researcher at AQR on econometirc panel data. Hence the name of the libray, pandas, is short for panel data analysis. There were many design choices of pandas that were not obvious to make when it was invented, which later lead to Wes McKinney's [10 things he hates about pandas](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/). When pandas starts to struggle with large in-memory dataset and slow groupby functions, [polars](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/) and [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/) can be very good alternatives.\n",

        "In your repository, you may notice there is a `README.md` file. This is a markdown text file. In notebooks, you can write markdown alongside with code to better communicate with stakeholders. This practice is known as literature programming and is commonly adopted by data scientists. Surely, you can write everything in a Word document. But markdown gives you the flexibility to think, code and write at the same time. Markdown also let you focus on writing rather than formatting, include citations and math equations painlessly, and execute code in the documentation.\n",

You can also convert jupyter notebooks into a quarto documents, slides, web pages, pdf or word. It is mighty and flexible. There are still some rough edges in terms of installation and virtual environments, I [complained a lot](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/1661#issuecomment-1204181009) in their GitHub issues.
