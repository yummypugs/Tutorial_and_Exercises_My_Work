        "\n",
        "You may have used the automatic playlist continuation feature on Spotify. As a matter of fact, Spotify even hosts a [challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge) to develop a system for the task of automatic playlist continuation, with a dataset of 1 million playlists consist of over 2 million unique tracks. Let us think of a simplified way to solve this challenge:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Each playlist is a vector of 2 million unique tracks;\n",
        "2. We can find the most similar playlist to what the user is playing;\n",
        "3. Suggest the song which the user has not listened to.\n",
        "\n",
        "It may sound easy, but finding a similar vector with 2 million dimensions is almost impossible. We need a way to reduce the dimensionality of these vectors. Random projection is one simple way. For a $m \\times n$ matrix $A$, it is a projection from $\\mathbf{R}_n \\to \\mathbf{R}_m$ when applied to $n$-dimension $x$:\n",

        "$$\n",

        "\n",
        "Johnson-Lindenstraus theorem simply proves that there is a theoretical guarantee that the errors will be smaller than some number for any random projection $\\mathbf{R}_n \\to \\mathbf{R}_m$. If you are fine with this number of errors, you can go ahead with this projection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let us say, we are fine to project the playlist vector to 2 thousand dimensions. Then we need a random matrix which has a shape $2\\ \\text{thousand} \\times 2\\ \\text{million}$. This is still a fairly difficult problem, many solutions have been proposed. For this tutorial, we do a simple version of projecting $\\mathbf{R}_{200} \\to \\mathbf{R}_{10}$ using Normal Distribution. We first import `numpy`."
